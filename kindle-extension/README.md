# Kindle extension

To use the kindle extension:

- Build `kosync-light` or get a prebuilt binary
- Put the binary in `./kosync-light/bin/kosync-light`
- Copy the `./kosync-light` directory to `/mnt/us/extensions` (`/mnt/us/` is the directory the kindle exposes to a computer when connected via USB. If you have a modded kindle you probably already have an extensions folder in the root of your kindle's "USB")
- The extension should appear in KUAL
